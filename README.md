This project takes a dataset of mall customers, which includes their Annual Income and Spending Score, and uses two clustering algorithms—K-means and Fuzzy C-means—to group them into different clusters. It starts by showing a scatter plot of the raw data, then asks you how many clusters you want. After that, it runs both algorithms step-by-step, printing the centroids (cluster centers) at each iteration and plotting the clusters with cool visuals. Finally, it compares how well each algorithm did using metrics like execution time, Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and the number of iterations it took to finish. The goal is to see which algorithm works better for splitting up the customers into useful groups based on their spending habits!
